## The Task
The fictional company Ottivo wants to determine each of its employee's yearly vacation days for a given year.

Requirements:
- Each employee has a minimum of 26 vacation days regardless of age
- A special contract can overwrite the amount of minimum vacation days
- Employees >= 30 years get one additional vacation day every 5 years
- Contracts can start on the 1st or the 15th of a month
- Contracts starting in the course of the year get 1/12 of the yearly vacation days for each full month

##### List of employees:
| Name        | Date of Birth           | Contract Start Date  | Special Contract  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|-----:|
| Hans MÃ¼ller      | 30.12.1950 | 01.01.2001 | |
| Angelika Fringe      | 09.06.1966 | 15.01.2001 | |
| Peter Klever      | 12.07.1991 | 15.05.2016 | 27 vacation days |
